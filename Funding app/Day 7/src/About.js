                Technology and crowdsourced data have played a role in disaster management in multiple instances in the nations. However, disaster-related mobile apps have not yet taken off as a resource among users. The outreach of 33 freely available disaster-related mobile apps  is very limited with most of them being educational, a study has said, underscoring the potential of crowdsourcing through Global Positioning System (GPS)-enabled mobile apps in disasters.

                Wildfire and hurricane season are here. If disaster strikes, you'll fare better if you're prepared. It's important to have essentials on hand like drinking water, nonperishable food, battery-powered flashlights and phone chargers or power banks.
