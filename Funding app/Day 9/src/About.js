                <p>
                To use technology & local knowledge to simplify raising funds for creative ideas, causes, charities and other sectors. In the process we want to spur non-profit giving, innovation, accountability and transparency while creating a marketplace that rewards the truly creative and efficient.
                </p>
                <h2 className="text-uppercase">Our Vision</h2>
                <p>
                We desire to see every Indian contribute 2% of their income to charities. As lack of transparency is one thing which stops most of us from contributing to NGOs. We are trying to address this problem using our innovative model. We believe that with the effective use of technology and introducing crowd-funding to the Indian public, we can create a much effective giving culture.

                We the Natural Warriors are here to addresses the challenges of giving such as difficulty in discovering the right causes, trust deficit, and overall donor apathy. We share stories of pre-qualified individuals and groups with a network of its trusted community and partners, who either specialize in providing and supporting the local communities by promoting products or can connect with the cause to help with a donation.
